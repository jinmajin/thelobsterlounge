    genre: "Music",
    quote: '"We like to play music"',
    aboutMe: "Three years ago, two emerging solo artists from opposite sides of the country randomly collided, fell in love, and combined their talents to form Us The Duo. A few successful YouTube videos (28+ million views) encouraged these pop songwriters to write their own music together, leading them to produce their first self-titled album. After its release, Michael & Carissa got married and have been traveling and playing music together ever since.",
